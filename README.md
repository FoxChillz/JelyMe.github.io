# OI LISTEN UP THESE ARE THE RULES

 1. camelCase is the not goat. All variables, ids, classes need to become dashed-form.

 2. Every object needs to be somewhat modular so that we can copy paste without problems.

 3. ~~all backend must be spaghetti~~ It's about the front end user experience, if it doesn't feel nice, fix it.

 4. Good enough is not good enough. If it works for a basic prototype good on you but we need something polished here, which is unrealistically optimistic but we'll try right?

 5. Don't delete other's stuff without asking what it was used for, it might be important to their vision of the project.

 6. **COMMENT EVERYTHING**

 7. All of these rules apply in retrospect, with a grace period obviously, (we will refactor the code at school)
