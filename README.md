# Conventions Used Within This Codebase

 1. For all languages that is not HTML and CSS, use camelCase for all names, including variables and functions. For HTML and CSS, classes and IDs must be named where each word is separated by a dash, and all the letters have to be lowercase.
 
 2. Make sure that the CSS styling is grouped by attribute to avoid clustered CSS code! For example, all the code that has to do with fonts are grouped together in a class, and all the border stuff is grouped together, and so on! 

 3. Every object needs to be somewhat modular so that we can copy paste without problems.

 4. ~~all backend must be spaghetti~~ It's about the front end user experience, if it doesn't feel nice, fix it.

 5. The if statements need to be written in a form like this:
     ```javascript
    if (expression)
    {
       //code
    }
    ```

 6. Don't delete other's stuff without asking what it was used for, it might be important to their vision of the project.

 7. **COMMENT EVERYTHING**

 8. All of these rules apply in retrospect, with a grace period. The refactoring should be done before you push to this repo.
